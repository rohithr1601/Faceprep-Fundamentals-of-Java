Description

Ravi is not able to figure out the method to calculate the sum of the Zig-Zag pattern in the Matrix. Can you help Ravi to write a program to find the sum of Zig-Zag patterns in a given matrix?



Input Format

Input consists of 2 integers and 1 2D array.
Integers corresponding to the size of rows and columns.


Output Format

The output prints the sum of the zig-zag pattern.
Refer to the sample output.
Note: Size of row and column should be same


Sample Input

3

3

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 9



Sample Output

Sum of Zig-Zag pattern is 35



Explanation

The sum of zig-zag pattern is 1+2+3+5+7+8+9=35 and hence its prints 35


Case 1
Case 2
Input (stdin)
3
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Output (stdout)
Sum of Zig-Zag pattern is 35

                }
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Sum of Zig-Zag pattern is " + sum);
    }
