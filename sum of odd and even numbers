Dolores Abarnathy and Maeve Millay were playing a puzzle game with a given set of numbers. They need to find the odd and even numbers and find the sum of the odd numbers and the sum of the even numbers. Write a program to help them to solve the puzzle game and to win the mobile phone.

Input Format:

Input consists of n+1 integers. 

The first integer corresponds to ‘n’, the size of the array. 

The next ‘n’ integers correspond to the elements in the array. 

Assume that the maximum value of n is 15.

Output Format:

Refer to sample output for details.

Sample Input:

5

2

3

6

8

-1

Sample Output:

The sum of the even numbers in the array is 16

The sum of the odd numbers in the array is 2


Case 1
Case 2
Case 3
Input (stdin)
5
2
3
6
8
-1

Output (stdout)
The sum of the even numbers in the array is 16
The sum of the odd numbers in the array is 2
