import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main

    public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int fdiff = in.nextInt();
        int com = in.nextInt();
        int c = (com - fdiff) / 3;
        int l = c + fdiff;
        System.out.println("Father lion's age is " + l);
        System.out.println("Cub's age is " + c);
    }
}
