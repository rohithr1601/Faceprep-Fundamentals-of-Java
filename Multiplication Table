Multiplication Table



Penny wanted to complete her graduation from the Community College of California. But being the newbee she is , she does not how to multiply two numbers. Sheldon being the good friend wanted to help Penny by writing C++ a program to print the multiplication table of an integer n.



Input Format:

Input consists of 2 integers. 

The first integer corresponds to n. 

The second integer corresponds to m(rows).



Output Format:

Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.



Sample Input 1:

5

4



Sample Output 1:

Enter n

Enter m

The multiplication table of 5 is

1*5=5

2*5=10

3*5=15

4*5=20



Explanation:

Multiplication of the 5th table from 1 to 4 is printed.



Sample Input 2:

5

6



Sample Output 2:

Enter n

Enter m

The multiplication table of 5 is

1*5=5

2*5=10

3*5=15

4*5=20

5*5=25

6*5=30



Explanation:

Multiplication of the 5th table from 1 to 6 is printed.


Case 1
Case 2
Input (stdin)

        System.out.println("The multiplication table of " + n + " is");
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            int sum = i * n;
            System.out.println(i + "*" + n + "=" + sum);
        }
    }
