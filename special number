Description

Professor Kishore wanted the kids to learn about Special numbers. (A two-digit number is said to be a special number if the sum of sum of its digits and the product of its digits is equal to the number itself. For example, 19 is a special number. The digits in 19 are 1 and 9. The sum of the digits is 10 and the product of the digits is 9. 10+9 = 19.)

Can you help Kishore to write a program to find all special numbers between 2 limits m and n (both inclusive)? Assume that m and n are two-digit numbers.



Input Format

Input consists of 2 integers m and n.

        for (int i = m; i <= n; i++) {
            int s = 0;
            int p = 1;
            int t = i;
            while (t != 0) {
                int d = t % 10;
                s = s + d;
                p = p * d;
                t = t / 10;
            }
            if (s + p == i) {
                System.out.println(i);
            }
