Description

Chander started working for Bing and he wanted him to write a program to generate Collatz Sequence. The rules for generating the Collatz sequence are: If n is even, n = n / 2. If n is odd, n = 3n + 1.

For example, if the starting number is 5 the sequence is: 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 It has been proved for almost all integers, that the repeated application of the above rule will result in a sequence that ends in 1.



Input Format

The input is an integer 'n' which denotes the first term of the sequence.



Output Format

As output, print the numbers in the sequence and also print the number of times the rule has to be applied in order to reach 1.
